          <h3>Sneak throught the Facility to secure the secret documents!</h3>
          <p>
            Alternate Agency is a game where the player must match colors with the camera to avoid detection.<br>
            They can use closets to change their outfit in order to fool the cameras.<br>
            The facility houses reactive mirrors that act as a gateway into a mirror dimension, proceed with caution.<br>
            The player must traverse with care and exquisite timing, making sure they are never seen.
          </p>
          <h3>Greatest Difficulty</h3>
          <p>
            For this project, creating a sense of progression was perhaps the hardest thing to do correctly.<br>
            Making sure the player could traverse the level with relative ease, given they made the right moves, was very important.<br>
            So I had to make sure the main mechanic was worked well enough into the levels to make sure that the player<br>
            had to use a significant amount of grey matter to proceed.
