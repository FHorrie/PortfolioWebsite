        <h1>Halo: Zero</h1>
        <h3>Halo: Zero, remade in SDL2 using a custom engine</h3>
        <p>
          Enter John 117, known as Master Chief, during a surprise attack on the Reach Facility.<br />
          Move quickly and eliminate all Covenant on your path as you are the key to stopping this invasion! <br>
          Pick up guns and ammo along the way to make sure you can finish the fight. <br>
          Do you have what it takes to save Reach?<br><br>

          Halo: Zero is a project I made approximately 6 months after starting my learning journey in C++<br>
          The project is made in a custom SDL2 framework provided by Howest Digital Arts & Entertainment.<br>
          It was a major leap in my development knowledge and skills, as it was the first big project I made
        </p>
        <h3>Greatest Difficulty</h3>
        <p>
          Since this game uses spritesheets by default, so for my rework, i wanted to "modernize" this<br>
          for master chief's torso. Instead of uisng a sprite sheet for rotation, I wanted continuous rotation<br>
          based on mouse position which was harder to figure out than expected.<br>
          The UI was also equally interesting to figure out, however this was less of a time sink.
